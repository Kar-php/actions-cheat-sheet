:page-description: A quick reference for GitHub Actions
:byline: GitHub Actions give you the flexibility to build automated software development lifecycle workflows. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create  custom workflows in your repository. GitHub Actions are automated processes allowing you to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub, but you can also use them to automate any step of your workflow: merging pull requests, assigning labels, triaging issues to name a few.
